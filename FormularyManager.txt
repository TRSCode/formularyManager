Feedback:
- when starting to add a medication, auto fill name and other fields
- import and file to load meds
- scan in meds
- digital signatures
- pre populate inventory field with qty on hand
- med dosing calculator or a sheet with weight/dosing chart
- consider button or check box for turn-in to change location to turn-in and then one for turn-in complete
- when complete, remove from DB
