# Formulary Manager
## Full-Stack MERN application

This project intends to accomplish the following:
* Track medications by percent on hand
* Track expiration dates of medications giving the user a warning if meds will expire w/i 30/60/90 days (maybe set status for expiration)
* There will be user levels (full-access and view only)
* Full-access users will be able to add and remove formulary items
* Full-access users will be able to conduct inventories and update supplies on hand
* Users will be able to view medications by name or location (self, room, safe etc..)
* View only users will be limited to view the formulary and status of medications
